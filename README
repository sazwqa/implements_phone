=== Implements Phone

Helpers to assist in adding phone numbers to models.

=== Using in model

Add the following in your model

  implements_phone :validate => [:phone], :invalidate => [:additional_phone]
  
Options:

validate:     Enforces validates_presence_of on the field(s)
invalidates:  Doesn't enforces validates_presence_of on the field(s)

All the fields are still validated according the following regex:

/^([0-9]){3}\-([0-9]){3}\-([0-9]){4}([\-]){0,1}([0-9]){0,4}$/

When you write implements_phone in your model, you get the following methods:

phone_apart
phone_apart=
formatted_phone

phone_apart accessor is used to get/set values for the phone field.
formatted_phone gives phone formatted for use in views, like:

321-321-3213 Ext. 3213

=== Using in view

You get a helper +phone_field+ for use in view. Use it as follows:

<%= phone_field(@user, :phone_field) %>

Here as evident the first parameter is the object of the model on which implements_phone is used 
and second paramter is the name of the phone field.
